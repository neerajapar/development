seals are cute
Seals have a layer of fat under skin called blubber, which keeps them warm in cold water. Their slick fur coat is streamlined for gliding through water. A seal's whiskers help it to detect prey in dark murky waters. Seals live on average for 25 - 30 years, females usually live longer than males.
